# Detecting ecDNA structures from long read data
A repository for scripts, utilities, notebooks, and other modules supporting long-read identification of ecDNA species from sequencing data.

There are three main folders that will be used for organizing our analysis code:
* `./notebooks` will store jupyter notebooks for interactive analysis and plotting.
* `./scripts` will store scripts for automated, pipeline processing of data.
* `./utilities` will store functions and modules that are helpful / necessary for analyzing the data.

Our best practices will be to write functions in separate utilities files that will be imported into jupyter notebooks or scripts.
